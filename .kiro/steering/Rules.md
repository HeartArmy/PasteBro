   Add Rules to this file or a short description and have Kiro refine them for you:   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
Be a sniper when making code changes, be precise and try to not make any unnecessary changes.
Try to get outcome with as few code changes as possible.
Also keep UI simple and nice looking like Apple, Steve Jobs, Jony Ive style.
Check to see if the intended changes were made, please confirm that.
Please never run any NPM Run or Build command, I will do it myself. 
Never use next/image since its expensive.
I love brevity in responses, no need of long summaries.
When it comes to Mac App make it as native as ppossible and make sure no memory leaks as this will be for Mac Intel & ARmM primary users as those laptops are weak. So i need to be careful of memory and GPU and cpu usage of my users while making sure the app is smooth. And there should be no bugs so keep things simple.
Imagine you are a google senior engineer, write industry level production code
